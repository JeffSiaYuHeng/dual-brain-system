## Purpose

This file maps import/export relationships across the codebase.
**Critical for Planner**: Before modifying a file, check if it's imported by others.
If a file has many importers, changes may require updating Reference Scope or Context Scope.

## Statistics

- **Total Files Analyzed**: 0
- **Total Dependencies**: 0
- **Average Dependencies per File**: 0

## High-Impact Files (Top 20)

These files are imported by many others. Modifying them requires careful impact analysis.

*No high-impact files detected*

## How Planner Should Use This

### Before Creating Context Scope:

1. **Read this file** to understand the file's position in the dependency tree
2. **Check "High-Impact Files"** section first
3. **If modifying a high-impact file**:
   - Add key importers to **Reference Scope** (read-only)
   - OR add to **Context Scope** if they also need changes
   - Document potential side-effects in instruction

### Example Decision Flow:

```
Task: Modify lib/utils/validation.ts

Step 1: Check 06_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md
Step 2: Find validation.ts is imported by 12 files
Step 3: Identify top 3 importers:
  - app/auth/login/page.tsx
  - components/forms/UserForm.tsx
  - lib/actions/user-actions.ts

Step 4: Add to _INSTRUCTION.md:
  Context Scope:
    - lib/utils/validation.ts

  Reference Scope:
    - app/auth/login/page.tsx (uses validateEmail)
    - components/forms/UserForm.tsx (uses validatePassword)
```

## Maintenance

- **Update**: Run `npm run gen:graph` before planning sessions
- **Tool**: Uses madge (install: `npm install -g madge`) or built-in analyzer
- **Directories Analyzed**: app, components, lib, utils, hooks, context
- **File Types**: .ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx

## Integration with Evaluator

The Evaluator should verify:
- If a Context Scope file is high-impact, did the Coder test affected importers?
- Are breaking changes properly documented in 03_SERVER_ACTIONS.md?
